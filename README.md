Morse Code: A Concise Overview
Morse code is a system of encoding textual information through sequences of dots (.) and dashes (-), representing letters, numerals, and punctuation. It was primarily developed for long-distance communication using telegraph systems and remains a vital tool in emergency radio communications today.

Historical Context
Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel F. B. Morse and Alfred Vail to facilitate long-distance textual communication via the electric telegraph. The first successful Morse telegraph message was sent on May 24, 1844, from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland, with the words, "What hath God wrought."
Before Morse code, long-distance communication was slow and relied heavily on messengers or visual signals like semaphores. Morse code revolutionized communication by allowing near-instant message transmission over telegraph wires.

How Morse Code Works
Morse code represents each letter, digit, or punctuation mark as a series of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). These signals can be transmitted using:

Sound (e.g., beeps),

Light (e.g., flashing signals),

Written symbols, or

Tapping or hand signals.

Timing Rules:
A dot is 1 time unit.

A dash is 3 time units.

The space between parts of the same letter is 1 time unit.

The space between letters is 3 time units.

The space between words is 7 time units.

Morse Code Alphabet
Here is the International Morse Code representation for the English alphabet:

Letter	Code	Letter	Code	Letter	Code	Letter	Code
A	.-	G	--.	M	--	S	...
B	-...	H	....	N	-.	T	-
C	-.-.	I	..	O	---	U	..-
D	-..	J	.---	P	.--.	V	...-
E	.	K	-.-	Q	--.-	W	.--
F	..-.	L	.-..	R	.-.	X	-..-
Y	-.--
Z	--..

Examples of Words in Morse Code
HELLO = .... . .-.. .-.. ---

MORSE = -- --- .-. ... .

CODE = -.-. --- -.. .

CHATGPT = -.-. .... .- - --. .--. -
